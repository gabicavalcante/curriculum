Intern at the Digital Metropolis Institute (IMD), under orientation of Carlos Eduardo da Silva. I was working on a tool to a Multicriteria Approaches for Cloud Services Selection, to solve the issue of selection of cloud services based on the analysis and use of methods, models and algorithms for selection which meet multiple criteria.

With the visibility that cloud computing has been acquiring, it is observed that the provision of computational resources as services is growing increasingly, leading to a large number of services being offered. These services have heterogeneous managerial and technical specifications, so that organizations wishing to use such services need mechanisms to assist in the decision making process to choose one that best suits their needs.

**Technologies**: Java and RDF.
