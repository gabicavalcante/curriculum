Federated  identity  management  model  provides  a solution  for  credential  access  proliferation,  such  as  based  on passwords.  However,  it  only  takes  the  attacker  to  find  out  one password  in  order  to  personify  the  user  in  all  federated  service providers.  The  multi-factor  authentication  emerge  as  a  solution to increase the authentication process robustness.

In this project, I worked as Intern at GT-AMPTo (Multi-Factor Authentication for Everyone) to build a solution for multi-factor authentication to be used on the CAFe Federation. 

**Technologies**: Raspberry Pi, Arduino, C/C++, Python, Flask Framework, FIDO and NFC.

I worked as intern at Smart Metropolis Project, conducted in the Metropole Digital Institute (IMD) of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), in Natal-RN. In this project, I worked on Infrastructure Work Package (WP), and the activities developed by this WP are composed of two work fronts. The first one is related to the development, deployment, and operation of the computational environment (datacenter, servers, cloud, networks, etc.) to enable applications developed within the SmartMetropolis Project to work efficiently. 

In turn, the second one refers to the development of an autonomous smart hotspot for Internet access, with capacity to offer connectivity to people and devices in the urban environment. This research was supervised by Prof. Carlos Eduardo da Silva (http://smartmetropolis.imd.ufrn.br). My work on this project involved security, authentication, authorization.

**Technologies**: Python, Flask Framework, JS, Docker, Git.

Scientific Initiation Scholarship at the Digital Metropolis Institute (IMD), under orientation of Carlos Eduardo da Silva. I was working on a tool to a Multicriteria Approaches for Cloud Services Selection, to solve the issue of selection of cloud services based on the analysis and use of methods, models and algorithms for selection which meet multiple criteria.

With the visibility that cloud computing has been acquiring, it is observed that the provision of computational resources as services is growing increasingly, leading to a large number of services being offered. These services have heterogeneous managerial and technical specifications, so that organizations wishing to use such services need mechanisms to assist in the decision making process to choose one that best suits their needs.

**Technologies**: Java and RDF.
